  # By default, +camelize+ converts strings to UpperCamelCase. If the argument to +camelize+
  # is set to <tt>:lower</tt> then +camelize+ produces lowerCamelCase.
  #
  # +camelize+ will also convert '/' to '::' which is useful for converting paths to namespaces.
  #
  # Examples:
  #   "active_record".camelize                # => "ActiveRecord"
  #   "active_record".camelize(:lower)        # => "activeRecord"
  #   "active_record/errors".camelize         # => "ActiveRecord::Errors"
  #   "active_record/errors".camelize(:lower) # => "activeRecord::Errors"
  #
  # As a rule of thumb you can think of +camelize+ as the inverse of +underscore+,
  # though there are cases where that does not hold:
  #
  #   "SSLError".underscore.camelize # => "SslError"
